This directory tree can help with debugging and developing Symphero::Web
modules without their actual installation. You still need to say 'make'
after any changes though - it uses blib.

When you configure Symphero::Web for development you need to set
complete path to `devsite' directory as an answer to `Directory Name'
question.

Then say:
 make
 make test
 make devsite

You do not need to re-make devsite after that as the only thing that it
does is creating symbolic links to templates and tools.

You need to symlink projects directory to where you have some
Symphero::Web projects. As a reference you can use `docsite' from
default installation.

Make usual setup in apache pointing it to devsite/cgi-bin/symphero.pl
stub.

Good luck and thanx for helping with development.
