Revision history for Perl extension Symphero::Web.

0.5: 15-Mar-2001

    Documentation is expanded (Symphero::Web and
    Symphero::Objects::Page), yet a lot to write up :(

    `Outsub' is completely removed as outdated and not used anywhere.

    Methods in Page re-ordered and cleaned up a little bit.

    Fixed major bug in parser - it did not decode &amp; stuff as
    supposed. I do not know why I did not find that before :)

0.4: 8-Mar-2001

	Should be fully functional less foocom example site.

        :: is now supported in object names and refers to objects in
        subdirectories in usual way.

0.1: 23-Feb-2001

	Converted from current CVS version of Symphero.
